1. You are given two numbers n and k. You are required to rotate n, k times to the right. If k is positive, rotate to the right, i.e. remove rightmost digit and make it leftmost. Do the reverse for negative value of k. Also, k can have an absolute value larger than number of digits in n.
2. Take as input `n` and `k`.
3. Print the rotated number.
