1. You are given a number with certain constraints. The key constraint is if the number is 5 digits long, it will 
contain all the digits from 1 to 5 without missing any and without repeating any, eg; 23415 is a 5 digit long number 
containing all digits from 1 to 5 without missing and repeating any digit from 1 to 5.

2. Take a look at few other valid numbers - 624135, 81456273 etc.

3. Here are few invalid numbers - 139, 7421357 etc.

4. The inverse of a number is defined as the number created by interchanging the face value and index of digits of number.

5. E.g. for 426135 (reading from right to left, 5 in place 1, 3 in place 2, 1 in place 3, 6 in place 4, 2 in place 5 
and 4 in place 6), the inverse will be 416253 (reading from right to left, 3 in place 1, 5 in place 2, 2 in place 3, 
6 in place 4, 1 in place 5, 4 in place 6).

6. More examples, inverse of 2134 is 1243, and inverse of 24153 is 24153.

7. Take input `n` and print its inverse.
